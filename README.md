# LFICO Protocol - License-Free Initial Coin Offering Protocol

LFICO Protocol is a framework for users to offer digital assets without any licenses. Exchanges might have a license but offering tokens itself can be done by anyone thanks to [Generalized DEX](https://github.com/kentomisawa/generalized-dex), and [Sulfur Network](https://github.com/kentomisawa/sulfur) helps to corporate with regulated entities seamlessly.

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
